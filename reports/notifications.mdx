ClearView delivers reports through three channels. You can connect one or all of them — each subscription can use a different channel.

## Telegram

Reports are delivered as direct messages from the ClearView Telegram bot.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Dashboard">
    Open **Dashboard** in the sidebar and find the **Notification Channels** section.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click the Telegram link">
    Click **Connect Telegram**. This opens the ClearView bot in Telegram with a unique deep link.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Press Start">
    In Telegram, tap the **Start** button (or send `/start`). This automatically links your Telegram account to your ClearView profile.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Done">
    Your Telegram is now connected. You'll see a confirmation in both Telegram and the Dashboard.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
The deep link contains a temporary token that expires after **10 minutes**. If it doesn't work, go back to the Dashboard and generate a new one.
</Note>

**How it works:** When you click the link, a one-time token connects your Telegram user ID to your ClearView account. From that point on, the bot sends reports directly to your Telegram DMs. No group chats, no channels — just private messages to you.

## Discord

Reports are posted as rich embeds to a Discord channel of your choice using a webhook.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a webhook in Discord">
    In your Discord server, go to **Server Settings** then **Integrations** then **Webhooks**. Click **New Webhook**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the webhook">
    Give it a name (e.g., "ClearView Reports") and select the channel where you want reports posted. Click **Copy Webhook URL**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Paste the URL in ClearView">
    Go to **Dashboard** then **Notification Channels** then **Discord**. Paste the webhook URL and click **Save**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Done">
    Reports will now be posted to your selected Discord channel as formatted embeds with market data sections.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Create a dedicated `#market-reports` channel in your Discord server. This keeps automated reports organized and prevents them from cluttering your main discussion channels.
</Tip>

**What the reports look like in Discord:** Each report is posted as a rich embed with sections for each data category (prices, derivatives, positioning, macro). Quick Summaries are compact single-embed messages. Deep Syntheses are longer multi-section posts with the AI's written analysis.

## Email

Reports are delivered as formatted HTML emails.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Dashboard">
    Open **Dashboard** in the sidebar and find the **Notification Channels** section.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter your email">
    Type your email address in the **Email** field and click **Save**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Done">
    Reports will be delivered to your inbox as styled HTML emails.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Email format:** Reports arrive as clean HTML emails with proper formatting — tables for data, bold text for key figures, and clear section headers. They render well in Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail, and most modern email clients.

## Managing channels

You can update or disconnect any channel at any time from **Dashboard** then **Notification Channels**:

- **Change a webhook URL** — paste the new URL and save
- **Change your email** — type the new address and save
- **Disconnect Telegram** — remove the connection (you'll need to re-link if you want to reconnect)

<Warning>
If you disconnect a channel that has active subscriptions, those subscriptions will fail to deliver until you reconnect or switch them to a different channel.
</Warning>

## Which channel should I use?

| Channel | Best for | Pros | Cons |
|---------|----------|------|------|
| **Telegram** | Individual traders | Instant mobile notifications, easy to scan | Personal only, no team sharing |
| **Discord** | Teams and groups | Shared visibility, webhook is simple | Requires a Discord server |
| **Email** | Record keeping | Works everywhere, easy to search later | Can land in spam/promotions tab |

<Tip>
Most traders use Telegram for daily Quick Summaries (fast mobile scan) and Discord for weekly Deep Syntheses (shared with their team). Email works well as a backup archive.
