## Setting up a subscription

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Dashboard">
    Click **Dashboard** in the left sidebar, or press `Cmd+K` and type "dashboard".
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click New Subscription">
    The subscription form opens with three configuration options.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose frequency">
    - **Daily** — delivered every morning (UTC)
    - **Weekly** — delivered every Monday morning (UTC)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose report type">
    - **Quick Summary** — fast, template-based market snapshot. Pure data, no AI. See [Report Types](/reports/report-types) for details.
    - **Deep Synthesis** — comprehensive AI-generated analysis using 5 agents. See [Report Types](/reports/report-types) for details.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select delivery channel">
    - **Telegram** — direct message from the ClearView bot
    - **Discord** — posted to a channel via webhook
    - **Email** — formatted HTML email

    Haven't connected a channel yet? See [Notification Channels](/reports/notifications) for setup instructions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Click **Save**. Your first report will be delivered at the next scheduled time.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Multiple subscriptions

You can create as many subscriptions as you need. Common setups:

| Setup | Frequency | Type | Channel |
|-------|-----------|------|---------|
| Morning briefing | Daily | Quick Summary | Telegram |
| Weekly review | Weekly | Deep Synthesis | Discord |
| Email archive | Weekly | Deep Synthesis | Email |

Each subscription runs independently. You could receive a quick daily snapshot on Telegram every morning and a deep weekly analysis on Discord every Monday — both generated automatically by the AI agents.

## Managing subscriptions

From the Dashboard, each active subscription shows:
- **Report type** and **frequency**
- **Delivery channel** (with the connected account)
- **Next delivery** time (in UTC)
- **Edit** and **Delete** actions

Click **Edit** to change any parameter. Click **Delete** to remove the subscription. Deleted subscriptions stop immediately — no further reports will be generated.

## Report history

Below your active subscriptions, the Dashboard shows your **Report History** — a chronological list of every report delivered to you. Each entry shows:
- Timestamp of generation
- Report type (Quick Summary or Deep Synthesis)
- Delivery channel
- Status (delivered, failed, pending)

<Note>
All delivery times are in UTC. If you're in a different timezone, adjust accordingly. A "daily morning" report is generated at approximately 07:00 UTC.
</Note>

<Tip>
Start with a Daily Quick Summary to Telegram. It takes 10 seconds to generate and gives you a complete market snapshot you can read in 30 seconds. Add a Weekly Deep Synthesis later once you see the value.
</Tip>
