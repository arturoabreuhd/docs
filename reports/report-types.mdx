title: Report Types
description: Choose between a quick market summary and a comprehensive AI-powered deep synthesis.
---

ClearView offers two report types. Each serves a different purpose — pick the one that matches how you consume market information, or use both.

---

## Quick Summary

A fast, template-based market snapshot. No AI involved — pure data pulled from primary sources and formatted into a structured template.

### What's included

| Section | Data Points |
|---------|-------------|
| **Prices** | BTC and ETH spot prices with 24h change |
| **Derivatives** | Funding rate and direction (positive/negative) |
| **Open Interest** | Current OI with change over 24h |
| **Positioning** | Long/short ratio from Binance Futures |
| **Stablecoins** | Total stablecoin supply with recent change |
| **Macro** | DXY, VIX, and SPX levels |

### How it's generated

The system pulls data from 3 agents:
1. **Derivatives Agent** — funding rates, open interest, positioning from Binance Futures
2. **Macro Agent** — BTC/ETH prices from Binance Spot, DXY/VIX/SPX from EODHD/FRED
3. **Signals Agent** — long/short ratio from Binance Futures

Data is fetched, formatted into a fixed template, and delivered. No LLM is involved — this is a pure data pipeline.

### Characteristics

- **Generation time:** ~10 seconds
- **Format:** Structured sections with numbers and directional arrows
- **Interpretation:** None — data only, you draw your own conclusions
- **Best for:** Daily morning briefing. Scan in 30 seconds, know where the market stands.

## Deep Synthesis

A comprehensive, AI-generated market analysis. Five agents collect data, then Claude AI synthesizes a written report with context, cross-references, and implications.

### What's included

Everything in Quick Summary, plus:

| Section | What the AI adds |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Technical Analysis** | Trend direction, momentum state, volatility assessment based on indicators (SMA, MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands, ATR) |
| **Statistical Context** | Where the current move ranks historically — percentile of daily returns, comparison to similar moves |
| **Cross-Layer Synthesis** | Connections between derivatives positioning, price action, and macro context |
| **Risk Assessment** | Key risks and scenarios to watch |
| **Actionable Levels** | Price levels to monitor based on technical and statistical analysis |

### How it's generated

The system invokes 5 agents in parallel:
1. **Derivatives Agent** — funding, OI, positioning
2. **Macro Agent** — prices, stablecoins, macro levels
3. **Signals Agent** — long/short positioning
4. **Technical Agent** — indicator analysis across 5 layers (regime, trend, momentum, volatility, sentiment)
5. **Quantitative Agent** — statistical analysis of historical price data

All agent data is collected, then **Claude Opus 4.6** (the same model used in the Chat) synthesizes a written analysis. The AI cross-references data across agents — for example, connecting unusual funding rates with a momentum divergence and a macro shift.

### Characteristics

- **Generation time:** 30-60 seconds (5 parallel agent calls + LLM synthesis)
- **Format:** Written analysis with data points embedded in context
- **Interpretation:** Full AI analysis — what the data means, not just what the numbers are
- **Best for:** Weekly comprehensive review, or any time you want the full picture

## Recommended setup

<Tip>
Use **Quick Summary** for daily updates and **Deep Synthesis** for your weekly review. The quick summary tells you *what happened*; the deep synthesis tells you *what it means*.
</Tip>

A practical setup:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Daily Quick Summary to Telegram">
    Every morning, get a 30-second scan of market state on your phone. Check funding, positioning, and price levels before your day starts.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Weekly Deep Synthesis to Discord or Email">
    Every Monday, get a comprehensive AI analysis that connects the dots across derivatives, technicals, and macro. Use it to frame your thinking for the week.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Deep Synthesis uses the same AI pipeline as the Chat — the same models, the same agents, the same data sources. The only difference is it runs on a schedule instead of on-demand. If you like the quality of answers in Chat, you'll get the same quality in your automated reports.
