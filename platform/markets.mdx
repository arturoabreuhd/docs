The Markets page gives you a real-time view of traditional financial markets — the indices, currencies, and sectors that set the macro backdrop for crypto.

## What you'll see

The page is organized into four sections. Scan the indices first for overall risk sentiment, then check forex for dollar dynamics, and finally review the movers for sector-level signals.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Index Tracker" icon="chart-line">
    Major global indices — S&P 500, Nasdaq 100, Dow Jones, Russell 2000, FTSE 100, DAX, Nikkei 225, and more. Each shows the current price, daily change, and percentage move.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Forex" icon="money-bill-transfer">
    Major currency pairs — EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/JPY, AUD/USD, and others. These reflect capital flows between major economies and directly influence the dollar's strength.
  </Card>
  <Card title="DXY (Dollar Index)" icon="dollar-sign">
    The US Dollar Index, sourced from FRED's trade-weighted dollar index (DTWEXBGS). Updated daily — for intraday dollar moves, use the forex pairs as a proxy.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Top Movers" icon="ranking-star">
    The biggest gainers and losers across major indices. Useful for spotting sector rotations or individual names driving broader market moves.
  </Card>

### Market status

The page shows whether major exchanges are currently open or closed. This uses Finnhub's market status API.

<Note>
Market status is currently available for **US markets only** due to Finnhub free tier limitations. London and Tokyo exchange status may return null. Check the exchange's own website for non-US market hours during holidays or special sessions.

### How crypto traders use this page

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Risk sentiment">
    Equities lead crypto in risk-off events. If S&P 500 futures are down 2%+ pre-market, expect crypto to react within hours. Nasdaq is the more relevant index — tech-heavy, growth-oriented, and the closest analog to crypto's risk profile.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Dollar dynamics">
    The forex section tells you what the dollar is doing *right now*, not just what it did yesterday (which is all DXY shows). USD/JPY is particularly important — sharp moves often signal carry trade unwinds that spill into all risk assets including crypto.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Sector rotation">
    The top movers section can reveal sector rotation in real time. If defensives (utilities, healthcare) are leading and growth (tech, semiconductors) is lagging, the market is de-risking — and crypto is likely next.

## Tips

- **Forex moves often lead crypto moves by hours.** A sharp USD/JPY drop (yen strengthening) signals carry trade unwinding — leveraged capital is being recalled. Crypto, as the furthest-out risk asset, tends to feel this last but hardest.
- **Compare index performance to crypto.** Correlation between BTC and Nasdaq increases during risk events and decreases during crypto-specific narratives (halving, ETF launches, regulatory news). Knowing the current correlation regime helps you decide whether to watch equities or ignore them.
- **Watch Russell 2000 for liquidity signals.** Small caps are more sensitive to liquidity conditions than large caps. If the Russell is significantly underperforming the S&P 500, tightening liquidity is already hitting the most vulnerable assets — crypto may follow.
- **Market status matters for volatility windows.** Crypto moves differently when US equity markets are open vs. closed. The highest-volatility window for BTC is typically the first hour after US market open (9:30-10:30 ET), when equity flows spill into crypto.
- **Use the AI Chat for cross-market analysis.** Ask "How is the equity market affecting crypto right now?" and the TradFi and Macro agents will pull index data, correlations, and positioning to synthesize a cross-asset view.
