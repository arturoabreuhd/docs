The Home page is your starting point — a single screen that answers "what's happening in the market right now?" without requiring a single click.

## What you'll see

The Market Overview dashboard is organized into cards, each showing a key indicator with its current value, 24-hour change, and a sparkline for recent trend.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="BTC Price" icon="bitcoin-sign">
    Current Bitcoin spot price in USD with 24h percentage change. The sparkline shows intraday movement.
  </Card>
  <Card title="ETH Price" icon="ethereum">
    Current Ethereum spot price in USD with 24h percentage change. Useful for gauging altcoin sentiment relative to BTC.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Funding Rate" icon="percent">
    The annualized funding rate for BTC perpetual futures. Positive means longs are paying shorts (bullish crowding); negative means shorts are paying longs (bearish crowding).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Open Interest" icon="chart-line">
    Total open interest in BTC futures contracts across Binance. Rising OI with rising price confirms trend conviction; rising OI with flat price signals an incoming move.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Positioning Score" icon="scale-balanced">
    A long/short ratio derived from Binance Futures account data. Values above 50 indicate net long positioning; below 50 indicates net short positioning.
  </Card>
  <Card title="DXY (Dollar Index)" icon="dollar-sign">
    The US Dollar Index, proxied through the Federal Reserve's trade-weighted dollar index (DTWEXBGS). A rising DXY is typically a headwind for crypto.
  </Card>

### Reading the dashboard

The cards are designed to be scanned in seconds. Focus on the **24h change** values first — they tell you what moved. Then glance at the sparklines — they tell you *how* it moved (gradual drift vs. sharp spike). If something catches your eye, open the [AI Chat](/platform/chat) and ask for a deeper explanation.

<Tip>
The funding rate is one of the most actionable numbers on this page. When funding exceeds +0.03% per 8 hours (roughly 33% annualized), the market is aggressively long and historically vulnerable to a squeeze. Conversely, deeply negative funding often marks local bottoms.

| BTC Price | Binance REST — `/api/v3/ticker/24hr` | ~1 minute |
| ETH Price | Binance REST — `/api/v3/ticker/24hr` | ~1 minute |
| Funding Rate | Binance Futures — `/fapi/v1/fundingRate` | Every few minutes (settles every 8h) |

All data is fetched server-side through our API and cached with appropriate TTLs. You never connect directly to Binance or FRED — the platform handles that for you.

## Tips

- **Compare BTC price direction with funding rate direction.** If price is rising but funding is flat or negative, the move has room to run. If price is rising and funding is spiking, the move is getting crowded.
- **Watch OI divergences.** Price making new highs while OI declines means the rally is built on closing shorts, not new longs — it tends to be less durable.
- **DXY is a slow-burn indicator.** It won't predict the next hour, but sustained DXY strength above 105 has historically correlated with crypto weakness over weeks.
- **Use the Home page as a triage tool.** Scan it first, then ask the AI Chat for context on anything that looks unusual.
