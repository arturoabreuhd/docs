description: "Indicator-based analysis using a 5-layer epistemic framework -- regime, trend, momentum, volatility, and sentiment."
---

## Overview

The Technical agent does not just list indicator values. It follows a **5-layer epistemic framework** where each layer conditions how the layers below it are interpreted. The market regime is determined first, and every subsequent indicator reading is contextualized by that regime.

This is the key difference from a typical screener: RSI at 75 means something very different in a trending market than in a range-bound market. ClearView accounts for this automatically.

## The 5-Layer Framework

<Steps>
  <Step title="Regime (ADX)">
    **Is the market trending or ranging?** This is the most important determination because it changes how every other indicator should be read.

    - **ADX above 25:** Trending market. Trend-following indicators (SMA, MACD) are reliable. Momentum oscillators hitting "overbought" levels are less meaningful -- trends can stay extended for long periods.
    - **ADX below 20:** Range-bound market. Mean-reversion indicators (RSI, Bollinger Bands) are more useful. Trend signals will produce more false breakouts.
    - **ADX 20-25:** Transitional zone. The market may be shifting between regimes. All signals should be interpreted with lower confidence.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Trend (SMA, EMA, MACD)">
    **Which direction is the market moving?** Descriptive and lagging by nature.

    - SMA 50 and SMA 200 positioning (golden cross vs. death cross)
    - Price position relative to SMA 50 (above or below)
    - SMA 50 slope direction (rising, falling, flat)
    - MACD line, signal line, and histogram
  </Step>
  <Step title="Momentum (RSI, Stochastic, CCI)">
    **How fast is it moving? Is momentum exhausting?**

    - RSI (14) with regime-aware interpretation. In a trending market, RSI above 70 reflects strong momentum, not imminent reversal. In a range, it signals potential mean-reversion.
    - Stochastic K/D for normalized momentum
    - CCI (20) for trend extension vs. potential overbought/oversold readings
    - The agent explicitly notes that Stochastic and RSI are the same epistemic category -- they do **not** provide independent confirmation of each other.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Volatility (Bollinger Bands, ATR)">
    **How wide are the price swings?** Measures uncertainty, not direction.

    - Bollinger Bands (20-period): upper, middle, lower, and band width
    - ATR (14): absolute and percentage of price
    - When ATR exceeds 3% of price, the agent flags that all signals carry wider uncertainty bands and position sizing matters more than entry precision.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sentiment (News)">
    **What is the narrative around this asset?**

    - Aggregated news sentiment score from financial news sources
    - Five most recent headlines with dates
    - Sentiment is labeled bullish, bearish, or neutral based on the aggregate score
    - The agent notes that sentiment scores reflect media narrative, not market positioning.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Charts

A full analysis produces three interactive charts:

| Chart | Type | What It Shows |
|-------|------|---------------|
| **Price** | Candlestick | 60-day price action with SMA 50 (blue) and SMA 200 (amber) reference lines |
| **MACD** | Histogram | 60-day MACD histogram. Green bars = positive momentum, red bars = negative |
| **RSI** | Line | 60-day RSI with overbought (70, red) and oversold (30, green) reference lines |

## What You Can Ask

The agent supports 6 intents, selected automatically based on your question:

| Intent | Example Prompts |
|--------|----------------|
| **Full analysis** | "Full technical analysis of BTC", "TA for AAPL", "How does ETH look technically?" |
| **Trend** | "What's the trend for ETH?", "Is AAPL in an uptrend?", "SMA analysis for TSLA" |
| **Momentum** | "Is BTC overbought?", "RSI for NVDA", "Momentum check on ETH" |
| **Volatility** | "How volatile is AAPL?", "Bollinger Bands for BTC", "ATR for MSFT" |
| **News sentiment** | "What's the news sentiment for NVDA?", "Latest news on BTC" |
| **Specific indicator** | "What's the RSI for BTC?", "Show me the MACD for TSLA" |

## Cross-Layer Synthesis

When running a full analysis, the agent produces a **cross-layer synthesis** that identifies:

- **Agreements:** When multiple layers confirm the same thesis (e.g., trend and momentum both aligned bullish)
- **Contradictions:** When layers conflict (e.g., momentum weakening despite intact uptrend -- potential RSI divergence)
- **Limitations:** Context-specific caveats (e.g., "RSI above 70 is less significant in the current trending regime")

This is the most valuable part of the analysis -- it highlights where the data tells a consistent story and where it raises questions.

## Coverage

The agent works for both crypto and traditional assets:

- **Crypto:** BTC, ETH, SOL, and 30+ other tokens. Just use the ticker name (e.g., "BTC", "ETH").
- **Stocks and indices:** Any ticker on EODHD (e.g., "AAPL", "MSFT", "TSLA", "NVDA").

<Tip>
Always start with a full analysis. It gives you the complete 5-layer picture in one query. If you ask for just RSI, you lose the regime context that tells you how to interpret it.
</Tip>

<Tip>
Combine the Technical agent with Derivatives for crypto. Ask "What's the technical and derivatives setup for BTC?" to get both indicator analysis and funding/positioning data in one response.
