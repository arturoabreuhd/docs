## Overview

The Advisor is the most data-intensive agent in ClearView. While other agents focus on one data dimension, the Advisor pulls from 6+ data endpoints simultaneously to produce comprehensive research that would normally require checking multiple platforms.

It operates through three distinct intents: **Deep Dive**, **Scanner**, and **Portfolio Analysis**.

## Deep Dive

A comprehensive, multi-section analysis of any single stock or crypto asset. This is your pre-earnings research tool, your due diligence companion, and your starting point for any position you are evaluating.

### What It Covers

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Price & Valuation" icon="chart-line">
    Current price, 52-week high/low, P/E, forward P/E, PEG ratio, price-to-book, price-to-sales, beta
  </Card>
  <Card title="Financials & Growth" icon="chart-bar">
    Revenue TTM, EPS, revenue per share, profit margin, operating margin
  </Card>
  <Card title="Profitability" icon="percent">
    Return on equity, return on assets, dividend yield, dividend per share, short ratio

  <Card title="Analyst Ratings" icon="users">

  </Card>
  <Card title="Insider Activity" icon="building-columns">
    Recent insider transactions (last 10), net buy vs. sell summary with transaction values
  </Card>
  <Card title="News & Sentiment" icon="newspaper">
    Five most recent headlines, aggregated sentiment score (bullish/neutral/bearish)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Options Flow" icon="arrows-left-right">
    Put/call ratio for the nearest expiration, total calls and puts
  </Card>
  <Card title="Upcoming Catalysts" icon="calendar">
    Next earnings date and EPS estimate (scans the next 90 days)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

The deep dive also produces a **52-week candlestick chart** showing the full price history for the past year.

### Example Prompts

- "Give me a deep dive on AAPL"
- "Analyze NVDA in detail"
- "Tell me everything about TSLA"
- "Deep dive on BTC"

<Note>
Options data availability is limited. EODHD returns no data for many tickers (particularly non-US and crypto). When options data is unavailable, the agent omits that section rather than showing empty data.
</Note>

## Scanner

Describe what you are looking for in plain English, and the agent translates your criteria into a market screen, runs it, and enriches the results with real-time prices and fundamentals.

### How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="You describe what you want">
    Use natural language: "Find large-cap tech stocks with low P/E" or "Show me high-dividend stocks above $50."
  </Step>
  <Step title="Agent builds screener filters">
    Your description is translated into structured filters: sector, market cap range, dividend yield, exchange. The screener searches US-listed equities.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Results are enriched">
    Each matching stock is enriched with real-time price data and fundamentals (market cap, P/E, dividend yield, sector). Results that require P/E filtering are post-filtered since the screener API does not support direct P/E queries.
  </Step>
  <Step title="You receive a ranked table">
    Up to 10 matching stocks with key metrics, sorted by market capitalization by default.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example Prompts

- "Find large-cap tech stocks with P/E under 20"
- "Show me high-dividend stocks above $50"
- "Screen for beaten-down growth stocks"
- "Find healthcare stocks with high margins"

### Supported Filters

| Filter | How to Express It |
|--------|-------------------|
| Sector | "tech stocks", "healthcare companies", "financial stocks" |
| Market cap | "large-cap", "above $10B market cap", "small-cap" |
| Dividend yield | "dividend above 3%", "high-dividend" |
| P/E ratio | "P/E under 20", "low P/E" |
| Price | "stocks above $50", "under $100" |

## Portfolio Analysis

Paste your positions in any format, and the agent returns a structured analysis of your portfolio with concentration alerts and sector breakdown.

### Input Formats

The agent parses positions flexibly. All of these work:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Simple list">
    "Analyze my portfolio: 100 AAPL, 50 MSFT, 200 TSLA, 0.5 BTC"
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Descriptive">
    "I have 100 shares of Apple, 50 Microsoft, and 2 Bitcoin"
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Mixed">
    "50 NVDA, 100 shares of Google, 30 Tesla, 1 ETH"
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Common company names are resolved automatically (Apple to AAPL, Google to GOOGL, Bitcoin to BTC, etc.).

### What You Get

- **Current value** for each position with real-time prices
- **Position weights** showing what percentage each holding represents
- **Sector breakdown** across your entire portfolio
- **Weighted P/E** for the portfolio as a whole
- **Concentration alerts** when any sector exceeds 40% or any single position exceeds 30%
- **Loss alerts** when a position is down more than 50% from cost basis (if cost basis is provided)

### Example Prompts

- "Analyze my portfolio: 50 AAPL, 100 TSLA, 0.5 BTC"
- "I own 200 shares of NVDA, 100 MSFT, and 50 AMZN. How does my portfolio look?"
- "Portfolio check: 30 GOOGL, 40 META, 1000 SOL"

<Tip>
The Advisor combines data from 6+ EODHD endpoints per query, making it the most comprehensive single-query analysis available. Use it when you want a complete picture, not just a price check.
</Tip>

<Tip>
For stocks approaching earnings, run a deep dive first. It shows the next earnings date, EPS estimates, insider activity leading up to the report, and options flow -- all in one query.
</Tip>

<Info>
The Advisor is different from the TradFi agent and the Technical agent. Use **TradFi** for quick data lookups (current price, yield curve, calendar). Use **Technical** for indicator-based analysis (RSI, MACD, Bollinger). Use **Advisor** for comprehensive multi-section research reports.
